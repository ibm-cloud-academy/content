# Preparing a macOS machine for the Labs
This document provides the steps for installing the software required to begin the exercises on a Mac computer. The sequence is as follows:  
1. Install curl  
2. Install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools
3. Install Java 1.8  
4. Create JAVA_HOME environment variable
5. Install Xcode  
6. Install Gradle  
7. Install node.js   
8. Install the MYSQL client

## Step 1: Install curl
1. In your browser, go to `http://macappstore.org/curl/`. Follow the installation instructions on the web site.
2. Verify curl is installed by typing the following into a terminal window:
`curl http://www.google.com`
3. Verify that the response is the HTML for the Google page.  
**NOTE**: If the response is __The document has moved__, then curl was successfully installed, but the url is not correct. According to your geography, you need to change the extension.
4. If you do not have curl installed, you can get it from the Mac App Store (http://macappstore.org/curl), or you can find various version binaries and source code at https://curl.haxx.se/download.html.

## Step 2: Install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools

1. Follow the instructions at: 
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview
to install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools.

## Step 3: Install Java JDK 1.8
1. In a browser, open https://www.oracle.com
2. In the list of menu options, click __Downloads and Trials__.
3. Click __Java for Developers__.
4. In the list, look for the newest version that starts with __Java SE 8__. At the time of writing, the newest version was Java SE 8u171. In that section, click the __DOWNLOAD__ button under __JDK__ (Note: your minor version may be different)
5. In the section that lists installation files for the various operating systems, click the __Accept License Agreement__ radio button at the top.
6. Select the __Mac OS X x64__ file (jdk-8u171-macosx-x64.dmg or newer).  
7. Double-click the downloaded file to open it.
8. Double-click the package to unpack it. Follow the default installation instructions.
9. Verify that the installation was successful by typing  
`java` in a terminal window.
You should see a list of usage options.

## Step 4: Create JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Open bash_profile in an editor:  
`$ vi ~/.bash_profile`
2. Add the following line to the bottom of the file:  
`export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`
3. __Save__ and __close__ the file.  
4. In the terminal window, type  
`$ source ~/.bash_profile`
5. Verify that it is set correctly by typing  
`$ echo $JAVA_HOME`  
You should see the full path to the jdk.
6. Verify that your installation of Java is recognized. Type:  
`java â€“version`  
You should see information about the java version, the runtime environment, and Java HotSpot.

## Step 5: Install Xcode
1. In a browser search engine, type `xcode` and select [Xcode on the Mac App Store - iTunes Apple]( https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).  
2. Click the link __View in Mac App Store__.
3. Click the __Get__ button.
4. It changes to an __Install App__ button. Click it again.  
NOTE: The download is approximately 4.5GB. It may take a long time.

## Step 6: Install Gradle
1. Type
` brew install gradle`

## Step 7: Install node.js
1. Type   
	`brew install node `
2. Verify the installation:  
`node -v`  
The response is the version number (for example, v4.2.6).
3. Type  
`npm -v`  
Again, the response is the version number.

## Step 8: Install the MYSQL client
The easiest way to do this is to just install the full MYSQL product, then use the client from it. You should install MYSQL version 5.7.
